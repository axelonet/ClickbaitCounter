# ClickBait Counter

The aim of this project is to make a python code that would 
1. Recognize unknown faces first
2. Compare new faces to these already known faces
3. Keep a count of how many people appeared in these pictures how many times. 

Instead of making the algorithm search Google for faces, what I am thinking for now is to make the model find unknown faces and put them in a folder. 

Find occurences of these faces from the unknown's folder already created. Then later on if I recognise and change the file-name of the person to his name, the algorithm from that point forward can name him with his name.
